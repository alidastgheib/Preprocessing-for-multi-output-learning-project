Genbase Dataset:

The protein classes considered in are the 10 most important protein families:
PDOC00064 (a class of oxydoreductases), PDOC00154 (a class of isomerases),
PDOC00224 (a class of cytokines and growth factors), PDOC00343 (a class of structural proteins), 
PDOC00561 (a class of receptors), PDOC00662 (a class of DNA or RNA associated proteins), 
PDOC00670 (a class of transferases), PDOC00791 (a class of protein secretion and chaperones), and 
PDOC50007 (a class of hydrolases). 


For clarity of presentation, the Prosite documentation ID, i.e. the PDOCxxxxx number was used to represent that class. 
Similarly, the Prosite access number i.e. the PSxxxxx was used to represent that motif pattern or profile.
